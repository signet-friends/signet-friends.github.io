# Anxo SÃ¡nchez
**Bio**: PhD in Theoretical Physics (with distinction) from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, 1991. Fulbright postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA, 1993 - 1994. Currently, full professor of Applied Mathematics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and founder of the research group GISC in 1996. Associated researcher of the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Universidad de Zaragoza.

His research deals mostly with the applications of physics of complex systems to social and biological sciences; he has contributed to the advancement of different fields, from economics to condensed matter physics through ecology and theoretical computer science. During his career he has obtained relevant results for the different communities interested. Examples include the largest experiments ever carried out on cooperation on networks, the mathematical demonstration of the existence of Dunbar circles in personal relationships and of a counterpart of the circles in nonhuman primates, or the experimental measurement of the evolution of social norms.
