# Anxo SÃ¡nchez
**Bio**: PhD in Theoretical Physics (with distinction) from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, 1991. Fulbright postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA, 1993 - 1994. Currently, full professor of Applied Mathematics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and founder of the research group GISC in 1996. Associated researcher of the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Universidad de Zaragoza.

His research deals mostly with the applications of physics of complex systems to social and biological sciences; he has contributed to the advancement of different fields, from economics to condensed matter physics through ecology and theoretical computer science. During his career he has obtained relevant results for the different communities interested. Examples include the largest experiments ever carried out on cooperation on networks, the mathematical demonstration of the existence of Dunbar circles in personal relationships and of a counterpart of the circles in nonhuman primates, or the experimental measurement of the evolution of social norms.

# Anna Gallo
**Bio**: She is currently a PhD student at the IMT School For Advanced Studies Lucca (Italy) working under the supervision of Professors Tiziano Squartini and Diego Garlaschelli. She holds a Bachelor's degree (2019) and a Master's degree (2021) in Mathematics at the University of Florence (2021). Her Master's thesis focuses on the analysis of the metastable behavior of the Potts model on a square lattice. She has a record of publications on both mathematics and physics journals.

Her research interests concern probability theory, statistical physics of networks, and opinion dynamics. Her PhD focuses on the study of signed networks, the goal being that reformulating the most popular social theories within a statistical framework at both microscopic and mesoscopic levels.

# Chiara Boldrini
**Bio**: Chiara Boldrini is a Senior Researcher at IIT-CNR. Her research interests include human behavioral/cognitive models for the analysis and design of online social networks, human-centric decentralized AI, causal learning in pervasive systems, and social network structures in the Metaverse. She is the IIT-CNR co-PI for the National Extended Partnership in Artificial Intelligence FAIR, H2020 SoBigData++, and H2020 HumaneE-AI-Net projects, and has been involved in several EC projects since FP7. She currently holds the position of Editor-in-Chief for Special Issues at Elsevier Computer Communications and is a member of the Editorial Board of Elsevier Pervasive and Mobile Computing. She served as TPC chair of IEEE PerCom'24 and has been on the organizing committee of several IEEE and ACM conferences/workshops, including IEEE PerCom and ACM MobiHoc. Recently, she has served in the TPC of AAAI ICWSM (as a senior PC member), The Web Conference, ECML-PKDD, WSDM, among several others.
