# Anxo SÃ¡nchez
**Bio**: PhD in Theoretical Physics (with distinction) from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain, 1991. Fulbright postdoctoral fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA, 1993 - 1994. Currently, full professor of Applied Mathematics at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and founder of the research group GISC in 1996. Associated researcher of the Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Universidad de Zaragoza.

His research deals mostly with the applications of physics of complex systems to social and biological sciences; he has contributed to the advancement of different fields, from economics to condensed matter physics through ecology and theoretical computer science. During his career he has obtained relevant results for the different communities interested. Examples include the largest experiments ever carried out on cooperation on networks, the mathematical demonstration of the existence of Dunbar circles in personal relationships and of a counterpart of the circles in nonhuman primates, or the experimental measurement of the evolution of social norms.

# Anna Gallo
**Bio**: She is currently a PhD student at the IMT School For Advanced Studies Lucca (Italy) working under the supervision of Professors Tiziano Squartini and Diego Garlaschelli. She holds a Bachelor's degree (2019) and a Master's degree (2021) in Mathematics at the University of Florence (2021). Her Master's thesis focuses on the analysis of the metastable behavior of the Potts model on a square lattice. She has a record of publications on both mathematics and physics journals.

Her research interests concern probability theory, statistical physics of networks, and opinion dynamics. Her PhD focuses on the study of signed networks, the goal being that reformulating the most popular social theories within a statistical framework at both microscopic and mesoscopic levels.
