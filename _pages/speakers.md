# Renaud Lambiotte
**Bio**: Renaud Lambiotte is professor of Networks and Nonlinear Systems at the University of Oxford. He received his PhD in theoretical physics from Université libre de Bruxelles in 2004, and has been a Research Associate at ENS Lyon, Université de Liège, Université catholique de Louvain and Imperial College London, and professor of Mathematics at the University of Namur.
His research interests include network science, data mining, stochastic processes, social dynamics and neuroimaging. He has published around 130 peer-reviewed articles and one book on temporal networks. He is also the co-founder of L’Arbre de Diane, a publishing company at the interface between science and literature.

**Talk title**: *Structural balance beyond signed networks*

**Abstract**: Structural balance—whether in its weak or strong form—is a foundational concept in the theory of signed networks. In this talk, I will explore how this notion extends beyond its traditional setting to offer insight into more general classes of networks. In particular, I will demonstrate that structural balance provides a natural framework for analyzing complex-weighted networks, where edge weights are complex numbers, introducing phenomena such as signal rotation and interference. I will show how structural balance can be used to classify these networks and to describe the behavior of random walks on them. Notably, asymptotic local consensus emerges when the network is structurally balanced, while global consensus arises in strictly unbalanced cases. Finally, I will present a broader generalization in which signals propagate through nodes via arbitrary linear transformations associated with each edge, moving the discussion into higher-dimensional dynamics.

# Tiago P. Peixoto

**Bio**: Tiago P. Peixoto is a Full Professor at IT:U, and is also affiliated with the Department of Network and Data Science at the Central European University. He leads the “Inverse Complexity Lab”, which operates at the interface between statistical physics, computational statistics, information theory, Bayesian inference, and machine learning, and has as its main focus the study of inverse problems in network science and complex systems. Peixoto develops and maintains graph-tool — an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs and networks. He has a PhD in Physics from the University of São Paulo, and a Habilitation in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bremen. In 2019 he was the recipient of the Erdős–Rényi Prize in Network Science, awarded by the Network Science Society.

# Jana Diesner

**Bio**: Jana Diesner is a Full Professor at the Technical University of Munich, School of Social Science and Technology, Department of Governance, with an affiliate appointment at the School of Computing, Information and Technology. She leads the Human-Centered Computing group. Her interdisciplinary group works on methods from network analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and AI, and integrates them with theories from the social sciences and humanities to advance knowledge about socio-technical systems and responsible computing. Jana earned her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon, School of Computer Science. Jana joined TUM from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, where she was a tenured professor at the School of Information Sciences. There, she served as the Director of the Ph.D. Program, Director of Undergraduate Programs, and Director of Strategic Initiatives/Data Science.
