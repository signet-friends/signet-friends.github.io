**Talk title**: *Structural balance beyond signed networks*

**Abstract**: Structural balance—whether in its weak or strong form—is a foundational concept in the theory of signed networks. In this talk, I will explore how this notion extends beyond its traditional setting to offer insight into more general classes of networks. In particular, I will demonstrate that structural balance provides a natural framework for analyzing complex-weighted networks, where edge weights are complex numbers, introducing phenomena such as signal rotation and interference. I will show how structural balance can be used to classify these networks and to describe the behavior of random walks on them. Notably, asymptotic local consensus emerges when the network is structurally balanced, while global consensus arises in strictly unbalanced cases. Finally, I will present a broader generalization in which signals propagate through nodes via arbitrary linear transformations associated with each edge, moving the discussion into higher-dimensional dynamics.

# Tiago P. Peixoto

**Bio**: Tiago P. Peixoto is a Full Professor at IT:U, and is also affiliated with the Department of Network and Data Science at the Central European University. He leads the “Inverse Complexity Lab”, which operates at the interface between statistical physics, computational statistics, information theory, Bayesian inference, and machine learning, and has as its main focus the study of inverse problems in network science and complex systems. Peixoto develops and maintains graph-tool — an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs and networks. He has a PhD in Physics from the University of São Paulo, and a Habilitation in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bremen. In 2019 he was the recipient of the Erdős–Rényi Prize in Network Science, awarded by the Network Science Society.

**Talk title**: *Disentangling rankings, degree imbalance, and mixing preferences in directed networks*

**Abstract**: Many networked systems feature asymmetric pairwise interactions, such as predator-prey dynamics, social dominance, or neuronal signaling, which may reflect an underlying latent hierarchy. However, these hierarchies are often not the sole or even most relevant organizing principle; heterogeneous mixing and modular structures can also govern interactions independently of any directional ordering. In such situations, an a posteriori ordering of the nodes may result in a spurious ranking that is in fact unrelated any underlying process of network formation. In this talk I present a method to infer both hierarchical and modular organization in directed networks using a modified stochastic block model. The model assigns nodes to groups with an imposed order, favoring interactions that align with this hierarchy while also allowing arbitrary inter-group connectivity. By incorporating directed degree correction, the method distinguishes large-scale hierarchical patterns from local asymmetries in node connectivity, and allows us to deconflate ranked hierarchies from other heterogeneous directed mixing patterns. This approach offers a more comprehensive framework for understanding the dual influence of hierarchy, degree imbalance, and group preferences in complex directed networks.


# Jana Diesner

**Bio**: Jana Diesner is a Full Professor at the Technical University of Munich, School of Social Science and Technology, Department of Governance, with an affiliate appointment at the School of Computing, Information and Technology. She leads the Human-Centered Computing group. Her interdisciplinary group works on methods from network analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and AI, and integrates them with theories from the social sciences and humanities to advance knowledge about socio-technical systems and responsible computing. Jana earned her Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon, School of Computer Science. Jana joined TUM from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, where she was a tenured professor at the School of Information Sciences. There, she served as the Director of the Ph.D. Program, Director of Undergraduate Programs, and Director of Strategic Initiatives/Data Science.

**Talk title**: *Natural language processing to extract and enhance network data*

**Abstract**: Data on edge valence is hard to collect. For example, the reciprocity of friendship ties when elicited with questionnaires or surveys, is a little over 50%. This asks for alternative methods for data collection methods. I show how we have been using methods from natural language processing to identify edge signs, and how we used this approach to re-evaluate balance theory. I also show how biases in natural language processing methods lead to biased network analysis results.
